### 2D Object Detection
This is an example using yolov4.

To run the an object detection first create the .rt file by running:
```
rm yolo4_fp32.rt        # be sure to delete(or move) old tensorRT files
./test_yolo4            # run the yolo test (is slow)
```
If you get problems in the creation, try to check the error activating the debug of TensorRT in this way:
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DDEBUG=True
make
```

Once you have successfully created your rt file, run the demo:
```
./ demo <path-to-config>
```
In general the demo program takes 1 parameter, the ```<path-to-config>``` that is the path to che configuration file. The parameter is optional and its default value is ```"../demo/demoConfig.yaml"```.

The config file is a yaml file with the following attributes:
* ```net``` is the rt file generated by a test
* ```input``` is the path to a video file or a camera input  (on Linux)
* ```win_input``` is the path to a video file or a camera input  (on Windows)
* ```ntype``` is the type of network. Thee types are currently supported: ```y``` (YOLO family), ```c``` (CenterNet family) and ```m``` (MobileNet-SSD family)
* ```n_classes``` is the number of classes the network is trained on
* ```n_batch``` number of batches to use in inference (N.B. you should first export TKDNN_BATCHSIZE to the required n_batches and create again the rt file for the network).
* ```conf_thresh``` confidence threshold for the detector. Only bounding boxes with threshold greater than conf-thresh will be displayed.
* ```show``` if set to 0 the demo will not show the visualization (if n-batches ==1)
* ```save``` if set to 1 the demo will save the video of the demo into result.mp4 (if n-batches ==1)

N.B. By default it is used FP32 inference

### FP16 inference

To run the demo with FP16 inference follow these steps (example with yolov3):
```
export TKDNN_MODE=FP16  # set the half floating point optimization
rm yolo4_fp16.rt        # be sure to delete(or move) old tensorRT files
./test_yolo4            # run the yolo test (is slow)
#set net: yolo4_fp16.rt in the config file
./demo
```
N.B. Using FP16 inference will lead to some errors in the results (first or second decimal). 

### INT8 inference

To run the demo with INT8 inference three environment variables need to be set:

  * ```export TKDNN_MODE=INT8```: set the 8-bit integer optimization
  * ```export TKDNN_CALIB_IMG_PATH=/path/to/calibration/image_list.txt``` : image_list.txt has in each line the absolute path to a calibration image
  * ```export TKDNN_CALIB_LABEL_PATH=/path/to/calibration/label_list.txt```: label_list.txt has in each line the absolute path to a calibration label
  
You should provide image_list.txt and label_list.txt, using training images. However, if you want to quickly test the INT8 inference you can run (from this repo root folder)
```
bash scripts/download_validation.sh COCO
```
to automatically download COCO2017 validation (inside demo folder) and create those needed file. Use BDD instead of COCO to download BDD validation. 

Then a complete example using yolo3 and COCO dataset would be:
```
export TKDNN_MODE=INT8
export TKDNN_CALIB_LABEL_PATH=../demo/COCO_val2017/all_labels.txt
export TKDNN_CALIB_IMG_PATH=../demo/COCO_val2017/all_images.txt
rm yolo4_int8.rt        # be sure to delete(or move) old tensorRT files
./test_yolo4            # run the yolo test (is slow)
#set net: yolo4_int8.rt in the config file
./demo
```
N.B. 

 * Using INT8 inference will lead to some errors in the results. 
 * The test will be slower: this is due to the INT8 calibration, which may take some time to complete. 
 * INT8 calibration requires TensorRT version greater than or equal to 6.0
 * Only 100 images are used to create the calibration table by default (set in the code).

### Batching

#### BatchSize bigger than 1
```
export TKDNN_BATCHSIZE=2
# build tensorRT files
```
This will create a TensorRT file with the desired **max** batch size.
The test will still run with a batch of 1, but the created tensorRT can manage the desired batch size.

#### Test batch Inference
This will test the network with random input and check if the output of each batch is the same.
```
./test_rtinference <network-rt-file> <number-of-batches>
# <number-of-batches> should be less or equal to the max batch size of the <network-rt-file>

# example
export TKDNN_BATCHSIZE=4           # set max batch size
rm yolo3_fp32.rt                   # be sure to delete(or move) old tensorRT files
./test_yolo3                       # build RT file
./test_rtinference yolo3_fp32.rt 4 # test with a batch size of 4
```
